# Intermittent 401 Unauthorized Error in Next.js API Route with NextAuth

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Next.js API route protected by NextAuth intermittently returns a 401 Unauthorized error, even when a valid session exists.  The issue seems to be related to the timing of session retrieval and request handling.

## Problem

The API route uses `unstable_getServerSession` to authenticate requests.  However, in some instances, the session is not correctly retrieved, leading to the 401 error. This is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the session is fully established before accessing its data. Using `await` before session usage makes it wait for the result, fixing the intermittent error.
